# Regular Habits

This is an email notification system designed to send reminders for recurring events. The system was created to help users remember important dates and events by sending them automatic email reminders at scheduled intervals.

Unfortunately, this project has been discontinued halfway through and is no longer actively maintained. If you are interested in using this project, please note that there may be bugs or other issues that could affect its performance. We recommend that you use caution if you choose to continue using or modifying this codebase.

It was discontinued because we realised that there are many products like this already.

Thank you for your interest in this project. We hope that it has been useful to you.
